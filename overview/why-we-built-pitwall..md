# Why we built PITWALL.

### Introduction

We’ve been always on a journey since we first developed a “system” decades ago, operation where it requires better observability requires technologies in each domains keep evolving. This will continue unless we quit developing new applications. New tools are born everyday and choices of each enterprise have different combinations (silo). Despite the dev process being well connected as a tool chain, today’s enterprise ops team still have manual operations to switch one tool to another and capture the whole information to understand, troubleshoot and resolve an issue.

PITWALL (still a prototype) allows enterprise devops & security ops teams to correlate, aggregate information across different tools and identify what needs to be solved with a single click. The product helps organizations shorten MTTA/MTTI/MTTR by democratizing the skillset, knowledge and experience of experts (really hard to hire and retain) we depend heavily on today and this allows organizations to standardize the process much more transparent way.\

We were working in a publicly traded global solution provider across Asia and the US with over 300+ technology partners including a variety tools like Splunk, NewRelic, IBM/Instana, DataDog, Coralogix et al. We’ve been enabling the cutting edge technology tools for 10K+ enterprise clients, but at the same time, we’ve been constantly creating tools & information silo as we implement a new tool.

As the Silicon Valley team has been enabling different cloud native technologies since K8S was born in 2015, we’ve observed tools (proprietary / open source) getting more specialized with more consumable ways (Saas/Hybrid/Onprem) in each technology domain (logs, metrics, traces, security, cmdb etc.) to allow enterprise to gain another level of observability to bring their IT operation to the next level, this is undeniable fact that a single tool can not oversee the entire DevOps team’s operations and each enterprise has their own choices as their combination. This problem won’t be solvable unless we solve this, as a company one step closer to actual enterprise devops team last 50 years. The tool silo’s been continuously created across different organizations and different generations.

This journey has never been took off years but this brings the organization to build the foundation of your sustainable growth under the competitive market situation where it’s been much more difficult to hire and retain experts.
